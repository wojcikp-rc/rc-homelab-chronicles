## Overview

I recently set up a new server for my virtualization workload using an i3-N305 Mini PC running [Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview). Similar unit was reviewed by Patrick from STH in their [article](https://www.servethehome.com/almost-a-decade-in-the-making-our-fanless-intel-i3-n305-2-5gbe-firewall-review). Primary use case for this box is to host firewall and home automation containers.
